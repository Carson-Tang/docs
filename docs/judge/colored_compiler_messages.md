# Colored Compiler Messages
The DMOJ judge component understands ANSI codes, and can display them in HTML form inside submission status pages for more accessible compiler errors and messages.

## Enabling Colors in GCC 4.9+
The DMOJ judge automatically enables colors for newer GCC versions.

## Enabling Colors in GCC < 4.9
Colors can be enabled in GCC versions prior to 4.9 through the `colorgcc` package. If `colorgcc` doesn't work for you, there are alternative packages out there that accomplish a similar result.

```shell-session
sudo apt-get install colorgcc
```

Then, specify the `colorgcc` executable in place of the GCC executors in the judge configuration file. `colorgcc` will determine which compiler to use based on the file extension of the file being compiled.

### Using `colorgcc` alongside a GCC 4.9+ installation
It may be the case that you have multiple GCC versions installed, and that `colorgcc` will attempt to colorize GCC 4.9+ output instead of GCC < 4.9. By default, `colorgcc` uses the GCC executables in `$PATH`, but this behaviour can be overriden through a `.colorgccrc` file placed in the judge `$HOME`. The example below assumes you have an environment variable `$JUDGE_HOME` set to the home directory of the judge user.

```shell-session
echo 'color-g++: /usr/bin/g++' >> $JUDGE_HOME/.colorgccrc
echo 'color-gcc: /usr/bin/gcc' >> $JUDGE_HOME/.colorgccrc
echo 'color-c++: /usr/bin/c++' >> $JUDGE_HOME/.colorgccrc
echo 'color-cc:  /usr/bin/cc'  >> $JUDGE_HOME/.colorgccrc
```

This will allow you to specify, for example, `color-g++` in the judge configuration file for a pre-4.9 GCC.

## Clang
Clang has native coloring support, enabled by default.
